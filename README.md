# Xiaomi Flower Care Teardown

This is a teardown of Xiaomi Flower Care (also known as Mi Flora, today sold
VegTrug).

Tipps on how to open: The white housing is sealed toghether, but it can be
broken up by using screw drivers and/or knifes. Best is to start from the bottom
side. The front side (logo side) is hold toghether with the PCB by a screw, but
the battery side is only connected by the seal at the boarder. Hence the battery
side needs to be removed first.
